<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ahmet Selim</h1>
<h5 align="center">I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer focused on building scalable, production-ready web applications and taking ownership of products from end to end — from architecture and development to deployment and maintenance.

My primary backend stack includes PHP with Laravel, where I build clean MVC architectures, develop RESTful APIs, implement authentication and authorization, and manage complex business logic. I work with both relational and non-relational databases, mainly MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, focusing on performance, data integrity, and scalability.

On the frontend side, I develop responsive and maintainable interfaces using JavaScript and TypeScript, working with modern frameworks such as Vue.js and React alongside HTML, CSS, and component-based UI patterns. I ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend systems.

I also have hands-on experience with Docker, using containerized environments to streamline development, ensure consistency across environments, and simplify deployment workflows. Additionally, I’ve worked on payment system integrations, deployment processes, and performance optimization in real-world applications.

I value clean code, system thinking, and continuous improvement. I actively ask questions, research best practices, and aim to build reliable software that delivers real business value while growing as an engineer.</h5>
